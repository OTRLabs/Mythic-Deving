# Using Foam

Foam is a collection VS Code extensions and recipes that power up the editor
into a full-blown note taking system. This folder contains user documentation
describing how to get started using Foam, what its main features are, and
strategies for getting the most out of Foam. The full docs are included in the
`foam-template` repo that most users start from.
