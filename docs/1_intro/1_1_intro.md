# Maintaining & Enhancing [Mythic C2](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic/)


## Introduction

This repository is a collection of `knowledge` related to the `Mythic C2 Framework` documentation, planning, code snippets, and other resources related to my attemps at maintaining and enhancing `Mythic`.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a *central location* for all of the `information` & `experience` I have gathered while working on maintaining `Mythic`.



The goal is to be able to use the writing in this, primarily markdown based repository is to enhance the output of LLMs when prompting them in relation to development, testing, and deployment of `Mythic`.
